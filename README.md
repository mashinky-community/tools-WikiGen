# tools-WikiGen
Tool to convert some game assets into resources to create wiki pages (wikitables, icons)

## What does it do
Creates wikitable for each buildable/buyable game asset (engines, wagons, vehicles, planes, town extensions etc.). Also creates icon for each asset if available.\
Furthermore, it creates wikitables for relative groups. E.g. all engines for each epoch, all cars to transport certain cargo type, etc.

## How to use
Run `MashinkyWikiGen.exe` in Mashinky main folder (where `Mashinky.exe` is located). Use buttons `Generate vehicles` / `Generate buildings` to process game assets. Wiki resources are generated to folder `\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\MashWikiGen`.
